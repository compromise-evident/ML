ML



Version 3.0.2   After training, model is saved as it were, but upon then testing
                (automatically as option 2) model is not loaded again because it
                resides updated in memory. But strictly option 3 will load model
                as it were. Efficient for big models; easy on storage/resources.

Version 3.0.1   Simplified,no more GPU. The GPU stuff is backed up in the folder
                "More_stuff". Now I have time to focus on gold:   "consensusML",
                where n models vote on classification.But hey,all this GPU stuff
                led me to batch-training perfection.

Version 3.0.0   Fast batch-training where a_batch=1 shows no difference in speed
                vs non-batch. Hence merging with ML-GPU.py.

Version 2.0.4   Learning-rate option added,  you'll need it for  final training.

Version 2.0.3   Faster in getting the number of items to train / test / cognize.

Version 2.0.2   Removed device "compute" option that was for future experiments.
                This ML via GPU is actually pretty stupid,  and not even closely
                ready for the general public when it comes to  minimalist setup,
                and especially the code. GPUs not worth it for mathematical fun.

Version 2.0.1   Actually useful stats. Average of  "off by n for classification"
                and a second "results_extra.txt" file: says OK if label correct,
                but if incorrect:  says actual label  and by how much  it's off.
                Original "results.txt" still there for  easy merging of  results
                for those who need consensus of multiple models (use StatMerge.)
                Stats after testing now reordered: % correct first, good layout.

Version 2.0.0   Minimalist, efficient.

Version 1.0.0   N2S: keep it below 200 lines!
