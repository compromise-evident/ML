Version 2.0.1   Actually useful stats. Average of  "off by n for classification"
                and a second "results_extra.txt" file: says OK if label correct,
                but if incorrect:  says actual label  and by how much  it's off.
                Original "results.txt" still there for  easy merging of  results
                for those who need consensus of multiple models (use StatMerge.)
                Stats after testing now reordered: % correct first, good layout.
